# JavaFXSceneToGraphics2D
A lot of frameworks rely on Graphics2D to provide rendering functionality. JavaFX does not provide an API to interface with Graphics2D. This project enables you to draw a JavaFX Scene to a Graphics2D. It does so by extending JFXPanel, give that the Graphics2D you want to draw on and use a JFrame to trigger drawing the Scene.
